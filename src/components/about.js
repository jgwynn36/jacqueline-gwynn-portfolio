                      <p>
                        I am a full stack developer working on an scrum team
                        that supports account management projects for a
                        financial company in Durham, NC. I started supporting
                        technology groups 8 years ago as a Quality Assurance
                        Engineer. About 6 years ago I transitioned into an
                        Automation engineer. During that time I began to enjoy
                        coding and wanted to learn more about technology. In
                        2019, I attended a boot camp at the UNC Chapel Hill for
                        full-stack engineering. I learned so much about
                        end-to-end application development.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I love learning and exploring new technologies and
                        pushing myself to become the best developer I can be.
                        Recently I began studying for the AWS Certified
                        Developer certification. Everyday I learn something new
                        supporting multiple teams. I am a change agent among my
                        team. I love learning new ways to influence the team and
                        better processes to fix issues.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In my spare time, I enjoy watching television and
                        spending time with my family. I am pretty good a board
                        games and love Sudoku. I even go as far as to buy the
                        books of Sudoku and can play for hours. I am passionate
                        about music and I used to play the clarinet. I currently
                        enjoy listening to my son learn the guitar and piano.
