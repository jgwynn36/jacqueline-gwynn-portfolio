                      I am a full stack developer working on an scrum team\n                        that supports account management projects for a\n                        financial company in Durham, NC. I started supporting\n                        technology groups 8 years ago as a Quality Assurance\n                        Engineer. About 6 years ago I transitioned into an\n                        Automation engineer. During that time I began to enjoy\n                        coding and wanted to learn more about technology. In\n                        2019, I attended a boot camp at the UNC Chapel Hill for\n                        full-stack engineering. I learned so much about\n                        end-to-end application development.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        I love learning and exploring new technologies and\n                        pushing myself to become the best developer I can be.\n                        Recently I began studying for the AWS Certified\n                        Developer certification. Everyday I learn something new\n                        supporting multiple teams. I am a change agent among my\n                        team. I love learning new ways to influence the team and\n                        better processes to fix issues.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        In my spare time, I enjoy watching television and\n                        spending time with my family. I am pretty good a board\n                        games and love Sudoku. I even go as far as to buy the\n                        books of Sudoku and can play for hours. I am passionate\n                        about music and I used to play the clarinet. I currently\n                        enjoy listening to my son learn the guitar and piano.\n                      </p>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section className=\"colorlib-about\">\n          <div className=\"colorlib-narrow-content\">\n            <div className=\"row\">\n              <div\n                className=\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-md-pull-3 animate-box\"\n                data-animate-effect=\"fadeInLeft\"\n              >\n                <span className=\"heading-meta\">What I do?</span>\n                <h2 className=\"colorlib-heading\">\n                  Here are some of my expertise\n                </h2>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row row-pt-md\">\n              <div className=\"col-md-4 text-center animate-box\">\n                <div className=\"services color-1\">\n                  <span className=\"icon\">\n                    <i className=\"icon-bulb\" />\n                  </span>\n                  <div className=\"desc\">\n                    <h3>Web Development </h3>\n                    <ul>Technology / Experience Level</ul>\n                      <ul>JavaScript / Intermediate</ul>\n                      <ul>Java / Beginner</ul>\n                      <ul>Node / Intermediate</ul>\n                      <ul>Angular / Intermediate</ul>\n                      <ul>React.js / Beginner</ul>\n                      <ul>Vue.js / Intermediate</ul>\n                      <ul>HTML / Intermediate</ul>\n                      <ul>CSS / Intermediate</ul>\n                  \n                    <p>\n                      I have experience building applications using JavaScript,\n                      Node, Angular, React, HTML, and CSS.\n                    </p>\n                    <p />\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"col-md-4 text-center animate-box\">\n                <div className=\"services color-1\">\n                  <span className=\"icon\">\n                    <i className=\"icon-bulb\" />\n                  </span>\n                  <div className=\"desc\">\n                    <h3>Middle Ware Development </h3>\n                    <p>I am learning API development using Java.</p>\n                    <p />\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"col-md-4 text-center animate-box\">\n                <div className=\"services color-3\">\n                  <span className=\"icon\">\n                    <i className=\"icon-phone3\" />\n                  </span>\n                  <div className=\"desc\">\n                    <h3>Big Data Analysis</h3>\n                    <p>\n                      Troubleshooting issues and providing data is a passion of\n                      mine.
