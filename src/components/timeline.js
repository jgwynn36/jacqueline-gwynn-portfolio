                        <p>I have been in a Quality Assurance role for the past 7 years.  I started as a QA Engineer specializing in project management and transitioned to a software engineer in test 2 years ago. A large portion of my responsibility is to inject quality into the development lifecycle early and educate others on the team of the importance of quality within development.  I currently spend most of my time writing code to automate the test and building sound regression suites to ensure that our end customers receive a highly functional application.</p>
