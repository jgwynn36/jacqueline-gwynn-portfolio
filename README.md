Personal Portfolio

This is a personal webpage that I have built to showcase my work that was completed within the UNC Coding Bootcamp.  The bootcamp is 24 weeks long and provides instructor led and handon practice for coding.  Some of the skills that I learned were HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, and GIT.
