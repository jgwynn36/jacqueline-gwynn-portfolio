I currently spend most of my time as a full stack engineer on the team writing code to automate the test and building sound regression suites to ensure that our end customers receive a highly functional application. I am also responsible for looking end-to-end as my current team owns UIs and APIs experiences.  I participate within writing the code for UI components and backup scrum master when needed.</p>\n                      </div>\n                    </div>\n                  </article>\n                                    <article className=\"timeline-entry animate-box\" data-animate-effect=\"fadeInLeft\">\n                    <div className=\"timeline-entry-inner\">\n                      <div className=\"timeline-icon color-3\">\n                        <i className=\"icon-pen2\" />\n                      </div>\n                      <div className=\"timeline-label\">\n                        <h2>Quality Assurance Engineer <span>2012-2017</span></h2>\n                        <p>I was a Quality Assurance Engineer for 5 + years.
